/* NS_DECLARE_CLASS_SYMBOL()
   Helper macro to declare a name that refers to the objc_class struct for a
   given class. Example of use:
      DECLARE_CLASS_SYMBOL(NSObject);
   This declares a value _OBJC_CLASS_NSObject of type const struct objc_class.

   As an annoying complication due to linkage differences, this must be used
   in a different file than the class's @interface for Darwin, but in the
   same file on all other platforms.

   WARNING: any use of this tecnique is officially an evil hack. It is
   necessary in Foundation to implement proper CoreFoundation semantics, but
   should never be used outside the Foundation framework.

   PORTABILITY NOTE: the current non-Darwin definition may not work properly
   on platforms which don't use the convention of prefixing symbols with
   underscores, or if class symbols are for some reason handled differently.
   If using GCC or Clang, the same __asm__ approach as used for Darwin can be
   used to get the appropriate symbol.
